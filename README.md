# Teachsync---Efficient-Teacher-Load-Allocation
In the teacher load assignment problem, we are given a set of N teachers and a set of M subjects. Each teacher has an integer workload capacity, which you can think of as the number of hours that the teacher is available to teach. Each teacher also has a list of subjects they have the background to teach. Each subject has an expected number of hours it takes to teach.


TeachSync automates the process of assigning teachers to courses by modeling a graph, with nodes representing teachers and courses, and edges representing the capacity or workload limits. 
It utilizes the Ford Fulkerson algorithm, a graph-based algorithm, to determine the maximum flow in a network and concepts of File Handling.
